Adding multiple remotes

# Syntax to add a git remote
git remote add REMOTE-ID REMOTE-URL

git remote add azura https://tharasupr@dev.azure.com/tharasupr/Project_esbohome/_git/Project_esbohome &&
git remote add gitlab https://gitlab.com/beaucafe/project_esbohome.git

Remove a remote
    # The syntax is: git remote remove REMOTE-ID
code:    
    git remote remove github

Push to multiple remotes
    # Create a new remote called "all" with the URL of the primary repo.
code:    
    git remote add all https://github.com/beaucafe/Project_esbohome.git

    # Re-register the remote as a push URL.
code:

git remote set-url --add --push all https://github.com/beaucafe/Project_esbohome.git &&  
git remote set-url --add --push all https://tharasupr@dev.azure.com/tharasupr/Project_esbohome/_git/Project_esbohome &&
git remote set-url --add --push all https://gitlab.com/beaucafe/project_esbohome.git

    # Replace BRANCH with the name of the branch you want to push.
code:    
    git push all master -f

Pull from multiple remotes

    It is not possible to git pull from multiple repos. However, you can git fetch from multiple repos with the following command:
code:
    git fetch --all

ISSUE 1
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/beaucafe/MasterProjects.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

after git pull --all  or git pull

ISSUE 2
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/beaucafe/MasterProjects.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
